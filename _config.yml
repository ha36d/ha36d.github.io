  Hi, I'm <b>Hamed</b> ‚Äî a passionate <b>Lead SRE</b> and tech junkie.

  Whether it‚Äôs <b>development, DevOps, system engineering, networks, or voice solutions</b> ‚Äî count me in! üöÄ

  In my free time, I'm a <b>solo traveler</b> and an avid <b>photographer</b>.
  Currently, I'm putting my soul into creating my very first music album. üé∂ Check out my project <a href="https://mooziq.app/">MooziQ</a> ‚Äî still early days, but growing!
