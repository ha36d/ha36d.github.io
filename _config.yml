  Hi, my name's Hamed. I’m Lead DevOps. I am a tech junkie (neither geek nor nerd), that can talk about music, cinema and beers for hours :) If it is related to dev, devops, system, network or voice, I'm in ;)

  But I am also skilled in <mark>Cooking and Making Cocktails</mark>.

  I am also a solo traveller. My photos and travel guides can be found in my flickr and blog respectively.

  More about me is at the end of this page.
