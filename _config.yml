  Hi, I'm <b>Hamed</b> — a passionate <b>Lead SRE</b> and tech junkie.
  When I'm not solving complex system challenges, you’ll find me talking for hours about <mark>music</mark>, <mark>cinema</mark>, and <mark>craft beers</mark>.
  Whether it’s <b>development, DevOps, system engineering, networks, or voice solutions</b> — count me in! 🚀

  In my free time, I'm a <b>solo traveler</b> and an avid <b>photographer</b>.
  I’m also a <b>Berlin Marathon</b> finisher — 1x marathon, 1x <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliotibial_band">IT band injury</a>.
  Currently, I'm putting my soul into creating my very first music album. 🎶 Check out my project <a href="https://mooziq.app/">MooziQ</a> — still early days, but growing!

  Bonus skills?
  I'm pretty handy in the kitchen and behind the bar — <mark>Cooking</mark> & <mark>Cocktail Making</mark> are my secret arts. 🍳🍸

        My latest translation book (in Persian) is out. 📚 Translating this book was a true labor of love.
